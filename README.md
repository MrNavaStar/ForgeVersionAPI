# [Forge Version API](https://mrnavastar.github.io/ForgeVersionAPI/)
#### Version 1.3 - Created by MrNavaStar

This api provides a simple way to get information about minecraft forge
installer versions. This information is provided via the [versions](https://mrnavastar.github.io/ForgeVersionAPI/forge-versions.json) endpoint.

## Important Note!
If you wish to automate the forge install process, please consider supporting
the forge project on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/LexManos/) as they rely on ad revenue to fund the project.
